# Content

This dataset contains 4 years of electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather data for Spain. Consumption and generation data was retrieved from ENTSOE, a public portal for Transmission Service Operator (TSO) data. Settlement prices were obtained from the Spanish TSO Red Electric Espa√±a. Weather data was purchased as part of a personal project from the Open Weather API for the 5 largest cities in Spain and made public here.
