# Energy Price Project Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to the Energy Price Project guide. Here, we offer a blend of casual conversation and technical insights to guide you through our project. Let's embark on this journey together!

## Menu Options
Upon arrival, you'll encounter a menu offering different pathways: ML Models, Technical Info, EDA, or Beyond. Choose the page that you want to see.

## Machine Learning Models
### Overview
We can start with the machine learning models. You can choose from different options to run your model like RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
### Getting Started
At first, pick a model from the dropdown menu. Next, specify a training start date. Then, press the "Run Model" button to initiate the training process and witness the model in action.

### Evaluation Metrics
Following model execution, we provide insightful metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics offer a comprehensive assessment of model performance.

## Technical Information
### Overview
See the technical information about the project you just ran. We'll explore parameters, features, and underlying methodologies in detail.

### Best Parameters
Uncover the optimal parameters derived from our model training process. These parameters are the ones selected by a gridsearch model that had the best performance 

### Feature Importance
Discover the significance of individual features through insightful visualizations. Understand which variables had the greatest influence in our predictive models.

## Beyond Machine Learning Models
### SARIMA Model
For comparison, we decide to run a SARIMA model, a powerful tool for forecasting time series with a seasonality trend.

### Getting Started
Select a star date and specify the forecast horizon. Witness the SARIMA model's predictive capabilities firsthand.

### Graphical Analysis
Visualize actual versus predicted energy prices through compelling graphical representations. Additionally, delve into statistical tests to validate model performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Overview
Our dataset spanning 2015-2019. Uncover trends, patterns, and insights regarding energy generation, consumption, and climate.

### Getting Started
Select a variable of interest and choose a desired frequency for analysis.

### Graphical Analysis
Navigate through histograms, correlation matrices, and other graphical representations. Gain deeper insights into the underlying dynamics of our dataset.
